#This version contains ogg vorbis music patches

ogg vorbis music files are stored in data/sound/music.
The engine looks for the text file data/sound/music/music.dat that contains tracks in the order of level selection ie:
track1
track2
track3

where track1 corresponds to level1, track2 corresponds to level2, etc



This is based off pitseb's branch.
This version is compatible with OpenPandora (ARM and GLES)
